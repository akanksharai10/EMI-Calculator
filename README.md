2. If the interest rate increases to 10%, and you cannot pay more than 30,000 as EMI, find the maximum amount of Loan you can take/afford for the same period?
3. For the Que 1. what is the total interest paid by you year-wise (from the 1st year to the 15th year). Also, what is the total cumulative interest paid by you in 15 years?
4. For the Que 1., in how many months would you have paid at least 50% of the Principal amount.
